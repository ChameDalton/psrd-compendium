# Pathfinder Code Modernization Methodology

## **Objective**
This document outlines the methodology for reviewing and transitioning the Pathfinder Open Reference **Java code (outside the database folder)** to a modern Flutter-based implementation. It focuses on **structural improvements**, **maintainability**, and **efficient migration**.

---

## **1. Categorize Code by Responsibility**
Identify the role of each Java file and organize them into key functional areas:

### **Data Handling**
- Parsing, structuring models (`StatBlockProcessor`, `ItemParser`).
- Migrate to Dart classes with `json_serializable`.

### **Business Logic**
- Game mechanics calculations (`RPGEngine`, `AbilityCalculator`).
- Refactor into stateless functions using Flutter services.

### **UI and State Management**
- Rendering, user interactions (`MainActivity`, `CharacterSheetFragment`).
- Convert XML-based layouts to Flutter widgets (`Column`, `Stack`, `ListView`).

### **Networking & API Calls**
- Remote data fetching (`PathfinderApiClient`, `UpdateManager`).
- Replace `HttpURLConnection` with Flutter's `http` package or `dio`.

---

## **2. Code Structure Evaluation**
Assess the existing code for best practices:
✅ **Encapsulation:** Separate UI from business logic.  
✅ **Modularization:** Refactor reusable components into distinct classes.  
✅ **Redundant Patterns:** Merge duplicate logic into centralized functions.  
✅ **Dependency Management:** Identify outdated libraries needing Flutter equivalents.

---

## **3. Mapping Java Constructs to Flutter**
### **Data Handling**
✅ Convert Java models into Dart classes (`json_serializable`).  
✅ Replace manual parsing logic with built-in Flutter utilities (`json.decode`).  
✅ Use `compute()` for async parsing to prevent UI lag.

### **Business Logic**
✅ Encapsulate calculations within `RuleProcessor`.  
✅ Use Flutter’s `riverpod` or `provider` for state management.  
✅ Migrate background operations to isolates for performance.

### **UI & State Management**
✅ Convert `Activities` and `Fragments` into Flutter **screens and widgets**.  
✅ Implement **state management** (`Provider`, `Riverpod`, `Bloc`).  
✅ Replace XML layouts with Flutter's **declarative UI** components.

### **Networking & API Calls**
✅ Replace `HttpURLConnection` with Flutter's `http` package or `dio`.  
✅ Structure API calls using `Future` & `async/await`.  
✅ Cache frequently requested data using `shared_preferences` or `hive`.

## **4. Incremental Migration Plan**
To avoid disruption, migrate code step by step:
1. **Start with standalone utilities** (e.g., mechanics calculations).  
2. **Refactor models & parsing logic** first, ensuring Dart compatibility.  
3. **Develop Flutter prototypes** for critical features.  
4. **Integrate UI components last** to ensure a smooth transition.

---

## **5. Documentation & Tracking**
Keep a **migration log** documenting:
- **Key components needing updates.**  
- **Challenges encountered.**  
- **Decisions made (e.g., choosing Riverpod vs. Bloc).**

This ensures alignment throughout the migration process and makes future updates easier.

---

## **Conclusion**
This methodology serves as a **structured guide** for modernizing Pathfinder’s non-database Java code. It provides **best practices, migration strategies, and Flutter mapping recommendations** to ensure a seamless transition.
