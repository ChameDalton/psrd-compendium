# Pathfinder Athenaeum Database Integration Guide

## ðŸ“Œ Overview of Database Structure
The **Pathfinder Athenaeum** project consists of multiple **SQLite databases**, each handling different aspects of the game.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Databases
- **Book Databases (`book-*.db`)** â†’ Stores individual rulebooks, spells, feats, creatures, and mechanics.
- **Index Database (`index.db`)** â†’ Manages global content indexing, allowing efficient searches.
- **User Database (`user.db`)** â†’ Stores user preferences, bookmarks, and collections.

### ðŸ”¹ Database Management
- **`DbWrangler.java`** â†’ Centralized database manager that handles **book loading, indexing, and user data**.
- **`BaseDbHelper.java`** â†’ Provides **low-level database operations**, including **creation, copying, and storage allocation**.

### ðŸ”¹ Game Mechanics Adapters
Each **game mechanic (spells, feats, creatures, etc.)** has a dedicated adapter for querying data:
- **`CreatureAdapter.java`** â†’ Handles creature data.
- **`FeatAdapter.java`** â†’ Manages feats and abilities.
- **`SpellAdapter.java`** â†’ Retrieves spell details.
- **`TrapAdapter.java`** â†’ Stores trap mechanics.
- **`VehicleAdapter.java`** â†’ Manages vehicle stats.
- **`SettlementAdapter.java`** â†’ Handles kingdom-building mechanics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Generalized Approach to Interfacing with Databases
### âœ… **Use Repository Pattern for Data Access**
Instead of **individual adapters**, Flutter should use **repository classes** to encapsulate queries.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Example: Spell Repository**
```dart
class SpellRepository {
  final Database db;

  SpellRepository(this.db);

  Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> fetchSpells() async {
    return await db.query("spells");
  }

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> fetchSpellById(int id) async {
    final result = await db.query("spells", where: "id = ?", whereArgs: [id]);
    return result.isNotEmpty ? result.first : null;
  }
}
âœ… Centralized Database Controller
Instead of managing each database separately, Flutter should use a singleton controller.

ðŸ”¹ Example: DatabaseController
dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

class DatabaseController {
  static Database? _database;
  static const int CURRENT_VERSION = 97;

  static Future<Database> getDatabase() async {
    if (_database != null) return _database!;

    final path = join(await getDatabasesPath(), "pathfinder.db");
    _database = await openDatabase(
      path,
      version: CURRENT_VERSION,
      onCreate: (db, version) async {
        await db.execute("CREATE TABLE spells (...);");
        await db.execute("CREATE TABLE creatures (...);");
      },
      onUpgrade: (db, oldVersion, newVersion) async {
        await db.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spells");
        await db.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS creatures");
        await db.execute("CREATE TABLE spells (...);");
        await db.execute("CREATE TABLE creatures (...);");
      },
    );

    return _database!;
  }
}
ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaways from Our Conversation
âœ¨ Patterns Identified
âœ… Modular Data Access â†’ Each game mechanic has its own adapter (CreatureAdapter, SpellAdapter). âœ… Dynamic Book Loading â†’ Books are stored as separate .db files, allowing new rulebooks to be added dynamically. âœ… Centralized Database Management â†’ DbWrangler.java ensures all databases are handled efficiently. âœ… Structured Error Handling â†’ Uses custom exceptions (BookNotFoundException) and storage checks (showLowSpaceError()). âœ… Query Optimization â†’ Uses dynamic column selection (implementProjection()) to filter and optimize database calls.

âœ¨ Best Practices for Flutter
âœ… Use sqflite for SQLite Management â†’ Ensures efficient database handling. âœ… Implement Repository Pattern â†’ Encapsulates queries for each game mechanic. âœ… Use Dynamic Book Loading â†’ Allows new rulebooks to be added without modifying code. âœ… Structured Error Handling â†’ Uses Dart exception classes (BookNotFoundException). âœ… Optimize Queries â†’ Uses query builders (dynamicQuery()) for flexible database calls.

ðŸš€ Gaps & Next Steps
ðŸ”¹ Potential Improvements
UI Components for Browsing Rulebooks â†’ Allow users to see installed books dynamically.

Advanced Search & Filtering â†’ Implement structured queries for spells, feats, creatures.

Migration Planning â†’ Ensure database integrity across updates.

Performance Optimization â†’ Reduce redundant queries using caching mechanisms.

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
ðŸ”¥ Would you like UI components that allow users to browse installed rulebooks dynamically? ðŸ”¥ Should we refine error handling, ensuring missing books show structured warnings? ðŸ”¥ Do you want book search and filtering functionality integrated into Pathfinder Athenaeum?
